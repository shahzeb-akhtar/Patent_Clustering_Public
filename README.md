<h2 id="head1"> Motivation of the project</h2>

I have been working in the Intellectual Property domain for 12 years now. One of the common tasks that has to be performed in the domain is patent portfolio evaluation. First step towards evaluating a patent portfolio is to categorize the patents into various buckets, then perform analytics on the categorized portfolio. The process can take anywhere between a week to a month depending on portfolio and team size. I believe, utilizing my knowledge gained in the Data Science nanodegree, I can substantially reduce the effort by 60 - 70% and also increase the quality of a patent categorization process.
