The disclosed technique creates the entity-key association strings by reading necessary data from a data structure stored in data storage unit. Both literal and regular expressions are supported without adversely affecting the query performance.","x":-1.0278491,"y":12.04959,"label_name":"Performance Enhancement","filing_year":2015,"priority_year":2012},{"publication_number":"US-9380087-B2","title":"Tagging users of a social networking system in content outside of social networking system domain ","assignee":"Facebook, Inc.","priority date":"8\/4\/2011","filing\/creation date":"4\/28\/2015","publication date":"6\/28\/2016","grant date":"6\/28\/2016","assignee_simple":"Facebook","first_cpc":"H04L65\/403","asset_type":"Grant","abstract":"Users of a social networking system can tag other users in content items that are provided outside of the social networking system, such as pictures that are viewable on a website that is external to the social networking system.

The crash bot can achieve this goal by identifying crashes as soon as they occur, creating a task for the identified crashes and assigning the task to the appropriate user automatically.","x":-8.184659,"y":11.880355,"label_name":"Performance Enhancement","filing_year":2015,"priority_year":2015},{"publication_number":"US-2016048527-A1","title":"Filtering suggested structured queries on online social networks ","assignee":"Facebook, Inc.","priority date":"5\/8\/2013","filing\/creation date":"10\/28\/2015","publication date":"2\/18\/2016","grant date":null,"assignee_simple":"Facebook","first_cpc":"G06F16\/24575","asset_type":"Application","abstract":"In one embodiment, a method includes receiving an text query inputted by a first user from a client device of the first user, generating a set of structured queries based on the text query, each structured query in the set corresponding to a grammar of a context-free grammar model, wherein each structured query is based on a natural-language string generated by a grammar of the context-free grammar model and comprises one or more tokens, wherein one or more of the tokens of each structured query correspond to one or more objects associated with the online social network, respectively, filtering the set to remove one or more structured queries from the set, each removed structured query having a quality score less than a threshold quality score, and sending one or more of the structured queries from the post-filtered set to the client device of the first user for display.","x":22.708664,"y":-25.028358,"label_name":"Social Networking","filing_year":2015,"priority_year":2013},{"publication_number":"US-10244042-B2","title":"Pushing suggested search queries to mobile devices ","assignee":"Facebook, Inc.","priority date":"2\/25\/2013","filing\/creation date":"10\/28\/2015","publication date":"3\/26\/2019","grant date":"3\/26\/2019","assignee_simple":"Facebook","first_cpc":"G06F16\/00","asset_type":"Grant","abstract":"In one embodiment, a method includes receiving an indication of a first location of a first user from a mobile-client system of a first user, generating one or more search queries based on the location of the first user, executing one or more of the search queries, and sending a plurality of search results corresponding to the executed search queries to the mobile-client system.","x":9.43411,"y":-12.688211,"label_name":"Social Networking","filing_year":2015,"priority_year":2013},{"publication_number":"US-2016048600-A1","title":"Composite Term Index for Graph Data ","assignee":"Facebook, Inc.","priority date":"12\/30\/2010","filing\/creation date":"10\/28\/2015","publication date":"2\/18\/2016","grant date":null,"assignee_simple":"Facebook","first_cpc":"G06F16\/9024","asset_type":"Application","abstract":"This application is directed to an indexing system for graph data.

If no one (or only some participants) joins the original user, the recorded video becomes an asynchronous artifact in the users' messaging history. In some embodiments, the live video may be recorded and shared in response to a first user initiating a video call with at least a second user, but receiving no answer. The first user begins to share a live video (which may become an asynchronous artifact). If the second user joins the call while the video is being recorded, the conversation may upgraded to a video conversation.","x":-17.593039,"y":20.559904,"label_name":"Social Networking","filing_year":2016,"priority_year":2016},{"publication_number":"US-2018130024-A1","title":"Systems and methods to identify resumes based on staged machine learning models ","assignee":"Facebook, Inc.","priority date":"11\/8\/2016","filing\/creation date":"11\/8\/2016","publication date":"5\/10\/2018","grant date":null,"assignee_simple":"Facebook","first_cpc":"G06Q10\/1053","asset_type":"Application","abstract":"Systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media are configured to generate a relevance score for each resume of a plurality of resumes associated with job candidates based on one or more machine learning models in a first stage associated with a job pipeline of an organization, the relevance score indicative of relevance of the resume in relation to the job pipeline.
